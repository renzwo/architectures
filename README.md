# architectures

In this repository i will collect some architectural overviews of software and server architecture i did the last years in different projects. They will not be linked to any project nor will anyone be able to get connections to any client or project. 

It's simply a collection of what i did in software architecture, redrawn and simplified. No original files are used.

The png files do not include external partner systems. In some cases there where over 15 external partners, mixed with REST, SOAP and Socket calls.
